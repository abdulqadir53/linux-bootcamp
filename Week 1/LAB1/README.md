# Lab 1: Create a Linux virtual machine with the Azure CLI

1. Launch Azure Cloud Shell: The links provided really helped with this. The Microsoft tutorials came with their own shells. I ran on both platforms.
2. Create a resource group
3. Create virtual machine
4. Open port 80 for web traffic
5. Connect to virtual machine
6. Install web server
7. View the web server in action
Very interesting exercise overall. Whether on the Azure CLI or git bash, it was worth the while
